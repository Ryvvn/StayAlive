## ✅ What Went Well

1. **Existing code base was solid** - NetworkGameManager, LobbyManager, PlayerController already had good network foundations
2. **Event-driven architecture** - UI decoupled from network logic via events
3. **Comprehensive story files** - Each story had clear AC and implementation notes
4. **Fast verification** - Stories 1.1 and 1.3 were mostly pre-implemented

## ⚠️ Challenges & Learnings

| Challenge | Root Cause | Learning |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| Duplicate managers | `GameNetworkManager.cs` vs `NetworkGameManager.cs` | Need to consolidate into one |
| UI Inspector setup | Scripts need Unity Editor configuration | Document required Inspector assignments |
